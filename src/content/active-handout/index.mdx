**Interactive handouts** is a tool to create online materials for courses. It's based on [mkdocs](https://mkdocs.org) and [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for authoring and [github](https://github.com) for publishing.

Besides publishing materials, **Interactive Handouts** also allows the addition of some interactive contents that enhance the students' learning. Our [Getting Started](getting-started/) section contains all you need to start creating awesome course materials. The _Reference_ menu lists all available interactive elements, as well as their recommended uses. The _Use cases_ menu shows suggestions of how to use these elements to support common active learning dynamics.
