# Progress Check

This plugin adds Progress Check buttons to a page. As with all plugins, it uses admonitions to indicate where the question should be placed. 

A Progress Check button hides all content after it, including other progress buttons.

## Recommended uses

* Indicating that students have to check their answers with instructors or peers before proceeding
* Indicating that students won't be able to proceed unless a certain set of tasks and readings is completed

## Syntax

Try clicking the button bellow. Reveals persist page refreshes, so students that have completed the material are not required to keep clicking buttons on subsequent visits.

```
!!! progress
    Button text goes here
```

!!! progress
    Show the rest

Rest of the material...
