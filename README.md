# Active Handout

## Setup

Install `pnpm` and run from the root folder:

```
pnpm install
```

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |

## Showing Toast notifications

You can show a toast notification by dispatching an event `"NotifyToast"` to `document`. You can use the function `@insperedu/active-handout/components/notifier/custom-events.ts`:

```typescript
dispatchNotification("YOUR MESSAGE HERE");
```

## Running for the first time with .auth enabled

You will need to setup a Firebase account and create a Realtime Database and a Storage within it. Then, copy the file `.env.example` to `.env` in your project's root folder.

After creating your Storage you will need to change the permission rules. Go to the Rules tab in the Firestore dashboard and change the content to:

```
rules_version = '2';

// Craft rules based on data in your Firestore database
// allow write: if firestore.get(
//    /databases/(default)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.isAdmin;
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read;
    }
  }
}
```
