**Active Handout** is a tool to create online course materials. It's built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for authoring and [GitHub](https://github.com) for publishing.

Besides publishing materials, **Active Handout** also allows the addition of some interactive contents that enhance students' learning. Our [Getting Started](getting-started/) section contains all you need to start creating awesome course materials. The _Reference_ menu lists all available interactive elements, as well as their recommended uses. The _Use cases_ menu shows suggestions of how to use these elements to support common active learning dynamics.
