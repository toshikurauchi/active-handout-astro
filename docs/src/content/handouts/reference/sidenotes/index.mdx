title: Sidenotes
---

A sidenote is composed of an anchor and the content. The anchor is an inline text that links to the sidenote content. The content is a modal (on mobile) or an aside (desktop) that only appears when the user clicks the anchor. See the example below.

This is a <SidenoteAnchor forId="1" client:idle>sidenote anchor</SidenoteAnchor>. You can add sidenotes in your MDX using the following syntax. For anchors:

<Sidenote id="1" client:idle>And this is the sidenote content. It will appear differently depending on the screen size.</Sidenote>

```md
<SidenoteAnchor forId="1" client:idle>
inline anchor text
</SidenoteAnchor>
```

The sidenote content may go anywhere in your document, but must match the `forId` value of an anchor. Also, you have to make sure the `id`s are unique.

```md
<Sidenote id="1" client:idle>
side note content can go anywhere
</Sidenote>
```

When using Astro, make sure to add `client:idle` in both the anchor and the content, so the sidenote becomes interactive.

## Markdown

You can use <SidenoteAnchor forId="2" client:idle>regular markdown</SidenoteAnchor> inside the sidenote.

<Sidenote id="2" client:idle>
You can use regular markdown here, so images should work:
