title: Sidenotes

You can add <SidenoteAnchor forId="1" client:idle>sidenotes</SidenoteAnchor> using the following syntax:

<Sidenote id="1" client:idle>Sidenote example.</Sidenote>

```md
Side notes are added like this:
<SidenoteAnchor forId="1" client:idle> inline text
</SidenoteAnchor>. The "inline text" will be
displayed inline, while the "side note content can go
anywhere" will be displayed to the right on larger
displays or as a modal on smaller displays.

<Sidenote id="1" client:idle>side note content can
go anywhere</Sidenote>
```

## Markdown

You can use <SidenoteAnchor forId="2" client:idle>regular markdown</SidenoteAnchor> inside the sidenote.

<Sidenote id="2" client:idle>
You can use regular markdown here, so images should work:

</Sidenote>

## Work in progress

The current implementation has a few known bugs:

1. Avoid starting or ending the document with long sidenotes, as they are **always** vertically centered on the reference;
2. Avoid adding two sidenotes too close from each other, because they may overlap.
