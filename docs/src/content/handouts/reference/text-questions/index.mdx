You can also add exercises with text answers (single or multiple lines).

## Recommended uses

- Writing a single line of code or command
- Identifying/finding something in an diagram or code snippet.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Tip">
  Examples of these are "Where does X occur?" or "In what section Y is
  located?". In this case we do not want to direct the students' gaze into
  specific parts of the code/image/etc. Instead, students should look at the
  whole and identify **where** they are supposed to look for what's asked.

### With validation

You can use [regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions) to validate student input. If you provide a `validation` attribute, the exercise will evaluate it as a regex and try to match to the student's answer.

```
<TextExercise slug="with-regex" validation="[aA].+">
Answer validated with a regex. Write a word that starts with the letter A.

  <Answer>
    Correct answer here. Take into account that students will phrase their answers differently and try to include elements that will let them evaluate their own answers.
  </Answer>
</TextExercise>
